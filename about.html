                The object of the game is to use every letter on <br>
                the key board that isn't inside the word that is given. <br>
                We hate that word, why would you even want to use those <br>
                letters. You can't repeat letters so this is actually <br>
                quite challenging. If there are less than 5 letters <br>
                left, than you win as well. Good luck.<br>
