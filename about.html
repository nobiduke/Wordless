                The object of the game is to use every letter on the key board<br>
                that isn't inside the word that is given. We hate that word, <br>
                why would you even want to use those letters. You can't<br>
                repeat letters so this is actually quite challenging.<br>
                If there are less than 5 letters left, than you win<br>
                as well.
