                The object of the game is to use every letter on <br>
                the key board that isn't inside the word that is given. <br>
                We hate that word, so why would you even want to use <br>
                those letters. You can only repeat vowels. The gold <br>
                boxes show you the scrabble score for each word. <br>
                I haven't really implemented a purpose for that, <br>
                but hey, it's there.<br><br>
